I study mathematical structures in quantum field theory.  My advisor is [Brian Williams](https://brianrwilliams.github.io/).   I am also interested in quantum information and quantum computation theory. 

I received my B.Sc. in Mathematics from the University of British Columbia in 2024.  Here is my [CV](/CV061425.pdf) (last updated on 06/14/2025).
