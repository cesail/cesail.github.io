I study mathematical structures in quantum field theory.  My advisor is [Brian Williams](https://brianrwilliams.github.io/).   I am also interested in the connections of topology and homological algebra  with quantum information and quantum computation. 

I received my B.S. in Mathematics from the University of British Columbia in 2024.  Here is my [CV](/CesaiLi_CV.pdf) (last updated on 06/11/2025).
