I study mathematical structures related to quantum field theory.  My advisor is [Brian Williams](https://brianrwilliams.github.io/).   I am also interested in topological quantum error correction codes and quantum computation in general.

I received my B.Sc. in Mathematics from the University of British Columbia in 2024.  Here is my [CV](/070825CV.pdf) (last updated 07/2025).
